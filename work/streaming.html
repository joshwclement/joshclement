  <h2>A big mess</h2>
  <p>Daily Burn is a streaming fitness video company. The video player has to work. It is the product. But over time, it became a mess. We wanted to update the workout detail, and also the home view, rows of workouts that are relevant to a user.</p>
  <p>

  <div class="img-work">
    <img src="../assets/work/streaming/1_audit.jpg">
    <p>From Roku to iOs, to Android to responsive web, everything was different. The fonts, images, buttons, content, icons, functionality. All different!</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>It didn't need to be complicated. Simple, responsive, easy to use. Consistent across all platforms (as much as possible). These were the design principles.</p>

  <div class="img-work">
    <video controls autoplay>
    <source src="../assets/work/streaming/roku-scroll.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <p>The workout detail screen had become very inconsistent. The functionality and visual design was broken.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>We looked at all the necessary content we had to display. What did the MVP look like. Could we get something simple, that worked for every platform? Prototypes, prototypes, prototypes! Developers for specific platforms helped to think up edge cases and platform specific constraints.</p>

  </div>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>We now have brand, visual and functional consistency across all our platforms. Not only is this a positive for our customers, but it's a big decrease in maintenance time, since we could clean up the code. The site performs better, and it provides us a more flexible system to introduce new features.
