  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <p>Daily Burn is a streaming fitness video company. The video player has to work. It is the product. As we rolled out new features, and expanded onto new platforms (and screen sizes), it started to become a mess.</p>

  <div class="img-work">
    <img src="../assets/work/streaming/1_audit.jpg">
    <p>On every platform, the fonts, images, buttons, content, icons, functionality. All different!</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>It didn't need to be complicated. Simple, responsive, easy to use. Consistent across all platforms (as much as possible). These were the design principles.</p>
  <p>The areas to focus was the workout detail screen, and also the home view, rows of workouts that are relevant to a user.</p>

  <h2>Prototypes, Data & Wires</h2>

  <div class="img-work">
    <video controls autoplay>
    <source src="../assets/work/streaming/roku-scroll.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <p>The workout detail screen had become very inconsistent. The functionality and visual design was broken.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>We now have brand, visual and functional consistency across all our platforms. Not only is this a positive for our customers, but it's a big decrease in maintenance time, since we could clean up the code. The site performs better, and it provides us a more flexible system to introduce new features.</p>
