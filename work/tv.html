  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Designing apps for TV can be tricky. Thereâ€™s no help out there. There is very little third party documentation or good resources for TV designers on the web. That's why I created <a href="http://www.bigscreenui.com">Big Screen Ui</a>, User interface design patterns seen on TV.
  <p>My mission is to make it easy for people to create amazing apps for TV.</p>

  <h2>Handpicked UI patterns</h2>
  <p>The first project for Big Screen, was simply collecting screenshots of apps that I liked. UI patterns abound for other platforms, like iOS or Android, but not so much for TV. There's now a huge resource of hundreds of high quality screenshots, covering tvOS, Android TV and even Roku. I even wrote a how-to screenshot guide and opened up the site to public submissions. Many hands make light work.</p>

  <h2>The tvOS Kit</h2>
  <p>My second project for Big Screen UI, was a free Sketch template that makes it easy to create beautfiul apps for Apple TV. I referenced Apple's tvOS Human Interface Guidelines, and created a document as accurate as possible. The kit included grid layouts, 14 predefined layout templates and 13 recreated system apps. Most importantly (for designers) every container, link and icon was pixel-perfect, customizable and ready to re-use for any TV project.</p>
  <p>The tvOS Kit was clearly something designers were looking for. It has seen thousands of downloads, shares, likes and recommendations.
