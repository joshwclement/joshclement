  <p>How big should a button be? That was the kind of question I was asking as I started to design for TV. I soon realized I would have to figure it out for myself. No articles, guides, templates, designers to follow, videos or even screenshots of other apps.</p>
  <p>Designing apps for TV can be tricky. Thereâ€™s no help out there. There is no third party documentation or good resources for TV designers on the web. So I created Big Screen Ui. My mission is to make it easy for people to create amazing apps for TV.</p>
