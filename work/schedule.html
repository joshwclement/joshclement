		<h1 class="title-project">The Schedule</h1>

		<p class="lede">We want to provide  expert guidance to help our customers reach  their goals. We provided a schedule for our programs, but it wasn’t much help.</p>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	 		<h2 class="title-section">The existing schedule</h2>
	    <img src="../assets/schedule/problems-example.jpg">
	    <p>Confusing, and behaved strangely.</p>
		</div>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="../assets/schedule/problems-feedback.jpg">
	    <p>Customers agreed. The existing schedule sucked.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="title-section">The problem</h2>

		<p class="lede">So there's more than one way to schedule. But why doesn't the schedule <span class="highlight">work</span> like a schedule should? We saw 4 major problems.</p>
		<p>1. The next workout to do wasn't obvious.</p>
		<p>2. If you miss a workout, it progresses without you. (Think broadcast TV vs Netflix).</p>
		<p>3. Completed workouts aren't communicated. Hard to know if you are making progress.</p>
		<p>4. No mobile or TV support. (Only 35% of our streams are from desktop web.)</p>

		<!-- Solutions -->

		<h2 class="title-section">Here's a few improvements we shipped...</h2>

		<h2 class="title-section"><span class="highlight">Improvement:</span> Show the next workout</h2>


	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="../assets/schedule/improve-correct_example.jpg">
	    <p>Now the 'next' workout is really clear.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="title-section"><span class="highlight">Improvement:</span> More control over your schedule</h2>

	    <p>Easy to switch. You can now explicitly change your next workout to any workout on your program's schedule.</p>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="../assets/schedule/improve-control-example4.jpg">
	    <p>Easy to understand. Workouts are chunked into groups of 7. Workouts are assigned numbers, but we removed weekdays and dates since they were too confusing.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- Marked as completed -->

		<h2 class="title-section"><span class="highlight">Improvement:</span> Completed workouts are marked as completed (duh)</h2>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="../assets/schedule/improve-completed-example.jpg">
	    <p>Completed workouts are clearly marked.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="title-section"><span class="highlight">Improvement:</span> Schedule is responsive, and available on all devices</h2>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="../assets/schedule/improve_responsive_example1.jpg">
	    <p>All mobile users can now easily view full schedule.</p>
		</div>

	    <img src="../assets/schedule/improve_responsive_example2.jpg">
	    <p>A content row for quick access to schedule on all platforms</p>
		</div>

		<!-- Final words -->

		<h2 class="title-section">Outcome</h2>

		<p class="lede">This project was about fixing stuff that was clearly broke. When your workout schedule is clear and easy to understand, we figure you'll do more workouts & cancel less.</p>
