	  <h2 class="title-section">Project Goals</h2>
	  <p>Here's a chunky bit of insight: Users who do a few workouts in their first week, stick around longer. Makes sense right?</p>

	  <p>Let's use that insight to improve our product. <br>1. First, we want new users to be placed into the right program. <br>2. If they are unhappy, move them into something better, based on their feedback.</p>

	  <h2 class="title-section">User Flows & Wires</h2>

	    <p>The intake survey had to be flexible to support different question types, and work on different platforms (mobile, web, tv).</p>

	    <p>After a user finishes their workout, the plan was to 'prompt' them to leave feedback. From that feedback, we could organize some recommendations.</p>

	  <h2 class="title-section">Outcome</h2>
	  <p>It turned out our users really liked a more guided, thoughtful introduction to the product. We've seen meaningful increases in our primary metrics (trial conversion, workout completions), and we've been able to collect much more data, to create a more personalized experience.</p>

	  <div class="img-work">
	    <img src="../assets/smart/smart-benefit-4.jpg">
	    <p>We now collect hundreds of responses everyday. We use these to craft the show, and make the best workouts possible.</p>
