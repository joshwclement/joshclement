      <h2 class="title-section">Why put effort into this?</h2>
      <p>"I cannot find a way to bookmark my favorite workouts or workouts I would like to take in the future." - Rose.</p>

      <p>"Is there a way to 'favorite' workouts… so if there is one, or several, that I would like to repeat, I can go to them directly rather than searching for them?" - Steven</p>

      <p>"It would be so awesome if we could "favorite" workouts so that we can go back to them easier. With 7 new workouts each week, it is easy to forget or not be able to find them quickly."- Karrie</p>

      <h2 class="title-section">Engagement & Outcome</h2>
      <p>Initial customer feedback has been positive. "Thankyou." "Wonderful". It’s too early to tell. Data to come. But we’ll look for certain types of behavior. are a lot of people using it? why? or not? Any change in major metrics (cancels, retention) Number of favorites - playback style stuff going on? Favoriting workouts they’ve played before, or they’ve never done before (queuing vs bookmarking use cases) Do people use the library/search less? How does it compare with active users.</p>
