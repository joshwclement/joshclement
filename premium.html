		<p class="lede">Let’s create a tiered, premium membership for Daily Burn customers.</p>

	 		<h2 class="title-section">Ok, but how would we measure success?</h2>
	    <img src="assets/premium/measure-success.jpg">
	    <p>Take-rate was the primary metric for this project. We'd also be tracking retention of premium users.</p>

		<h2 class="title-section">Planning</h2>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/newuser-flows.jpg">
	    <p>Signup has direct impact on revenue. We prototyped and tested two different flows against each other. Option A offers premium as a plan selection screen. Option B is a secondary offer, presented after user has signed up.</p>
		</div>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/newuser-wires.jpg">
	    <p>What flows would <span class="new">new</span> users go through and what would they would see?</p>

		<h2 class="title-section">Visuals & interactions</h2>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/exusers-blocks.jpg">
	    <p>For <span class="existing">existing</span> users, content would need to be restricted, in a smart, obvious way.</p>

	    <p>For <span class="existing">existing</span> users, content would need to be restricted, in a smart, obvious way.</p>

		<h2 class="title-section">Technical trouble</h2>
		<p>Existing users presented a big technical challenge. Since we supported several different payment processors, upgrading was not always possible.</p>


	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/pausedusers-flows.jpg">
	    <p><span class="paused">Paused and churned</span> users represent about 15-25% of our subscribers. We wanted to offer premium to these users when they reactivate.</p>
		</div>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/exusers-upgrade.jpg">
	    <p>One solution was an upgrade web-page that could handle subscription switches, or leave it to support.</p>
		</div>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/system.jpg">
	    <p>This upgrade system needed to work for all payment processeor/platform combinations. That’s a lot of flows, copy, and potential errors!</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="title-section">What we shipped</h2>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/ship-newuser.jpg">
	    <p>Simple, quick. A/B test. Explains benefits.</p>
		</div>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/ship-exuser.jpg">
	    <p>One quick tap to upgrade. Boom!</p>
		</div>

	 	<div class="img-work">
	    <img src="assets/premium/ship-pauseuser.jpg">
	    <p>Simple screen, but big upside for business.</p>
		</div>

		

		<h2 class="title-section">Results & Learning</h2>

		<p class="lede">40.33. That's the % of people paying us for premium in their first month</p>

		<p>For a first release, don’t try and be clever. Ship something that works and is simple. Iterate later.</p>

		<p>Writing copy is extremely difficult when there’s a million different protypes, builds and mockups floating around. Pick something that will become the ‘single source of truth’. Copywriters will love you.
