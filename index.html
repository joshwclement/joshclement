<p>Hi, my name is Josh Clement. I'm a NYC-based digital product designer.</p>

<p>Do great work. As a designer, I aim to better understand user needs and support them with delightful experiences. I’m currently practicing that mission in the fitness industry with Daily Burn, where we are empowering everyday people to enjoy regular exercise. I’m happiest when both the customer and the business are happy.</p>

<p>I have five years of professional experience working in digital design teams. I graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor’s degree in Communication Design. My primary strengths lie in visual and user interface design. <code>prototyping</code> I couple that with technical knowledge, problem solving and communication skills. During product development, I can help define the problem, ideate, prototype, and work through constraints to deliver the optimal solution.</p>
