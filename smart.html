	  <h2 class="title-section">Background</h2>
	  <p>When you join a new gym, it's nice if you're shown around, asked about your goals, and guided to the right activities to do. For new users starting a new trial, we didn't do any of this.</p>

	  <h2 class="title-section">Project Goals</h2>
	  <p>We based a lot of decisions around this chunky bit of insight: Users who did a few workouts in their first week, retained longer. So it was on us to 1. make sure we put them in the right program. 2. If for some reason we didn't get it right the first time, move them into something better, based on their feedback.</p>

	    <p>The intake survey had to be flexible to support different question types, and work on different platforms (mobile, web, tv).</p>

	    <p>After a user finishes their workout, the plan was to 'prompt' them somehow, to leave feedback. From that feedback, we could organize some reccomendations.</p>
	  </div>

	  <h2 class="title-section">Interactions & Visuals</h2>
	  <p>Colours, fonts, tiny details. How does each question transition? What does an error look like? Stuff like that.</p>

	  <h2 class="title-section">Outcome & Results</h2>
	  <p>Results of the test… Hypothesis: Displaying recommendations based on feedback will encourage users to complete more workouts / Change in # of completed workouts per month / Change in conversion rate / Change in cancellation rate / Survey completion rates and drop off points etc…</p>
	  <p>For 365, hundreds of freeform responses and ratings are collected every day. This information was used to make the product better.</p>
