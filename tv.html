      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Lead designer on Daily Burn 365, a live daily video series. My tasks involved product strategy, information architecture, wireframing, prototyping, visual design and presenting work to stakeholders. 365 was a success and is now a primary business focus for the company. We increased conversions to paid subscriptions, daily views by 70% and unique visitors by 250%.</p>

      <p>• Optimized the mobile sign-up experience. Conversions to trial increased over 10%, while exit rate from the paywall decreased. These additional signups led to a significant annual increase in revenue.</p>
      <p>• Championed design thinking. I led research activities such as experience mapping, internal workshops and individual user interviews. These efforts generated actionable customer insights and gave real-life context to our upcoming projects. We published, promoted and made our findings available to the broader design community.</p>
