      <h1 class="title-project">Streaming Fitness</h1>
      <p>Daily Burn produces fitness content. Our customers stream the conent into their living rooms and get fit. As we expanded onto new platforms (and screen sizes), our design system supporting that content started to fall apart.</p>

      <div class="img-work">
        <img src="assets/stream/stream-wire-4.jpg">
        <p>Fonts, buttons, content, icons, functionality. Inconsistent and a bit rusty!</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="title-section">Goals</h2>
      <p>Responsive, scalable, consistent. These were a few of our design principles for the project.</p>
      <p>We focused on two core screens. The workout detail screen, where users can see more info about a workout. Also the home view, where we show rows of relevant workouts.</p>

      <h2 class="title-section">Approach</h2>

        <p>How can our platforms share similar components?</p>

        <p>Built a new design system.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="title-section">Results</h2>
      <p>Brand, visual and functional consistency across all our platforms. Better experience for our users, also a big decrease in maintenance time, and faster to launch new improvements. The app <span class="highlight">performs better</span>, and it gives us a more flexible system for future features.</p>
